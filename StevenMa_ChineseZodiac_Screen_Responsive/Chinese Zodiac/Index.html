	<div class="description">
		The Chinese Zodiac or "Shengxiao," is a systematic plan of future action that relates to each year and is represented by animals with their reputed attributes.  According to its origin story, the 12 animals took part in The Great Race and each of their 12 positions represents their ranking upon finishing the race.  The order was Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and then Pig.  Another interpretation of the Chinese Zodiac was during the Han Dynasty, which referred to each animal as an Earthly Branch.  Each Earthly Branch represented a double hour period and all 12 animals represented a 24 hour day.  For example, the Ox&rsquo;s branch would be 01:00-2.59, as that is the time when they would be chewing cud slowly and comfortably.
